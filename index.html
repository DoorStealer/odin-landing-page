        <div class="section-two-text"> French fries, also known as "fries" or "chips" (in the UK), are a popular snack or side dish made from potatoes. The potatoes are typically cut into thin strips, although they can vary in size and shape, and are then deep-fried or sometimes baked until golden and crispy on the outside while remaining soft on the inside. The fries are often seasoned with salt, though other seasonings or toppings like pepper, garlic, or cheese can be added.

            French fries are a beloved fast food item, often served alongside burgers, sandwiches, or enjoyed as a standalone snack. Variations include curly fries, crinkle-cut fries, and waffle fries, each offering a unique texture. They are frequently accompanied by dipping sauces such as ketchup, mayonnaise, or aioli.

        <div class="section-three-first-desc">Crinkle-cut fries are a type of French fry that are characterized by their wavy, ridged texture. The unique shape is created by cutting the potatoes using a special crinkle cutter, which gives them a distinctive, zigzag pattern. These fries are typically deep-fried until golden brown and crispy on the outside, with a soft and fluffy interior. The ridges not only provide a unique texture but also help hold onto seasonings and dipping sauces more effectively than regular straight-cut fries.

            </div>
        <div class="section-three-second-desc">Sweet potato fries are a delicious variation of traditional French fries made from sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes. These fries are typically cut into thin strips or wedges and then either deep-fried, baked, or air-fried until golden brown and crispy on the outside while maintaining a soft, tender interior. Sweet potatoes lend a slightly sweet flavor to the fries, which pairs beautifully with savory seasonings like salt, pepper, garlic, or paprika. The fries can also be flavored with additional spices, such as cinnamon or cayenne pepper, to create different taste profiles. They are often served as a healthier alternative to regular fries due to the higher nutritional value of sweet potatoes, which are rich in vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants.

            </div>
        <div class="section-three-third-desc">Curly fries are a type of French fry known for their spiral, curly shape. The potatoes are typically sliced using a specialized spiral cutter, which creates a distinctive corkscrew or spiral pattern. After being cut, curly fries are deep-fried until golden brown and crispy on the outside, while remaining tender on the inside. They often have a seasoned coating, which gives them a flavorful, slightly spicy taste that distinguishes them from regular fries. The twisted shape and crispy texture make curly fries a fun and tasty option.

        <div class="section-three-fourth-desc">Waffle fries are a type of French fry characterized by their unique, lattice-like pattern. Made by slicing potatoes in a crisscross or grid pattern, often using a special waffle cutter, these fries have a distinctive texture with a combination of crispy edges and soft, tender interior. The crisscross shape not only gives them a fun appearance but also increases their surface area, allowing them to hold more seasoning and dipping sauces. Waffle fries are typically deep-fried until golden and crispy, but they can also be baked for a healthier option. Their ridged design provides extra crunch and helps retain heat, making them a popular choice.

            <div class="section-three-fifth-desc">Tornado fries are a visually striking and flavorful variation of French fries. Made by spiraling a whole potato onto a skewer, the potato is then sliced into a continuous spiral shape, creating a long, twisted fry. After being skewered and cut, the fries are deep-fried until crispy and golden brown on the outside, while maintaining a soft, tender interior. The unique twisted shape not only makes them eye-catching but also allows for more surface area, making them especially crunchy and perfect for holding seasonings or dipping sauces. Tornado fries are often served on the skewer for an extra touch of presentation. They are a popular street food or snack, commonly found at fairs, festivals, and food trucks. Their dramatic shape and crisp texture make them a fun and delicious alternative to regular fries.
